# Sudoku Solver

This project implements a **Sudoku Solver** using two different approaches:
1. **Simulated Annealing** â€“ a probabilistic optimization algorithm.
2. **Backtracking** â€“ a classic recursive search algorithm.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Solves Sudoku puzzles using **metaheuristics (Simulated Annealing)**.
- Falls back to **Backtracking** if no solution is found.
- Prints intermediate results during simulated annealing to show progress.
- Works on standard **9x9 Sudoku puzzles**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example
```bash
python sudoku_solver.py
